# STATS7022-practical

This is a one-day exam where I was asked to build and tune a random forest on the diamonds dataset from ggplot2 package in R to predict the price of diamonds.

The analysis include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing and model tuning. All the works were done using Rmarkdown

The dataset is loaded from ggplot2 package, and I only used a subset of the data per the instruction given to me. An Rmarkdown file and the output report in pdf is included
